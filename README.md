Animate Transition
===========

Library for transition animations between blocks (pages) in the application.

`Animate Transition` allows you to easily make transition between any two HTML elements. It can be used in different variety of situations, whatever you want to enhance appearance of your web site or navigate between pages in hybrid mobile application.

`Animate Transition` provides great performance due to using hardware accelerated CSS transitions. You can choose from 12 preset animation types for blocks, 8 animation types for popups or create your own CSS animation.

`Animate Transition` has no dependencies and supports all modern browsers, including Firefox 31+, Chrome 31+, Safari 7+, Opera 27+, IE 10+, iOS Safari 6.0+, Android Browser 2.3+

###Advantages

Unlike other libraries, `Animate Transition` let you not just animate one element, but made a transition between two in a way you like. It also has declarative style and provides callbacks to make sure that your code will be executed in right animation phase.

###Usage

Just include [animateTransition.min.js](https://github.com/Rapid-Application-Development-JS/AnimateTransition/blob/master/src/animateTransition.min.js) and [transitions.css](https://github.com/Rapid-Application-Development-JS/AnimateTransition/blob/master/css/transitions.css)

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="transitions.css"/>`

`<script src="animateTransition.min.js"></script>`

###Methods

#### blocksTransition

	blocksTransition(options)

Takes the object **options** as the parameter. The object has the following properties:

* **container** - container where the animation will take  place. If the property is not defined, by default will be used **document.body**
* **blockIn** - block, to which the transition is carried out. If it is not defined, by **blockOut** the block with the selected animation will disappear from the screen.
* **blockOut** - block, from which the transition is carried out. If it is not defined, by **blockIn** the block with the selected animation will appear.
At least one parameter ( **blockIn** or **blockOut** ) must be specified.
**container**, **blockIn**, **blockOut** can be both css selectors or already existing DOM Elements.
* **showOverlay** - optional overlay. If the property is not defined or set to false, overlay won't be shown. Overlay has default class `.transition-overlay` (See [transitions.css](https://github.com/Rapid-Application-Development-JS/AnimateTransition/blob/master/css/transitions.css))
* **animation** - animation name. Currently the following blocks animations are supported by default:
	- `slide-in`
	- `slide-out`
	- `fade-in`
	- `fade-out`
	- `cover-in`
	- `cover-out`
	- `cover-double-in`
	- `cover-double-out`
	- `revolution-in`
	- `revolution-out`
	- `bounce-in`
	- `bounce-out`

	As for popups you can choose from 8 animations:

	- `popup-scale-in`
	- `fade-in`
	- `cover-in`
	- `cover-double-in`
	- `cover-double-out`
	- `revolution-in`
	- `revolution-out`
	- `bounce-in`

To create custom animation with `animation_name`, you need to describe following css classes - .transition-`animation_name` for container animation, .`animation_name`-transition-view-to-show for blockIn and .`animation_name`-transition-view-to-hide for blockOut animation.

* `beforeTransition(blockIn, blockOut, container)` - function that will be performed before the transition; if it is set to **false**, the animation will not be performed.
* `onTransitionStart(blockIn, blockOut, container, e)` - function that will be performed at the start of the transition, where **ะต** is the event object.
* `onTransitionEnd(blockIn, blockOut, container, e)` - function that will be performed at the end of the transition, where **ะต** is the event object.

Properties **animation**, **beforeTransition**, **onTransitionStart** and **onTransitionEnd** are optional.



**Examples**


To navigate between two blocks:
```javascript
AnimateTransition({
   container: '.container',
   blockIn: '.newElement',
   blockOut: '.oldElement',
   animation: 'slide-in'
});
```

To show popup:
```javascript
AnimateTransition({
   container: '.container',
   blockIn: '.popup',
   animation: 'popup-scale-in'
});
```
